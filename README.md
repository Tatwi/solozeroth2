## Solozeroth 2
My mods and customizations which make [TrinityCore](https://www.trinitycore.org) (3.3.5) more enjoyable for my personal use during *solo play*.

## Documentation
Unlike my [previous version](https://github.com/tatwi/solozeroth), the **Solozeroth 2** repository contains only the changes that I have made to TrinityCore, rather than being a bloated fork of the entire project. This makes it easier for me to track my progress and for you to evaluate the mods. For simplicity, the sql directory in this repo corresponds to the sql/custom directory in the TrinityCore source structure.  

See [doc/README.md](doc/README.md) for detailed information about each mod and customization.
