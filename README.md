## Solozeroth 2
My mods and customizations which make [TrinityCore](https://www.trinitycore.org) more enjoyable for my personal use during *solo play*. Using the truly outstanding [NPCBots](https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots) fork of TrinityCore, which provides "hireable pet-like minions". 

## Documentation
Unlike my [previous version](https://github.com/tatwi/solozeroth), the **Solozeroth 2** repository contains only the changes that I have made to TrinityCore, rather than being a bloated fork of the entire project. This makes it easier for me to track my progress and for you to evaluate the mods. For simplicity, the sql/custom directory in this repo corresponds to the sql/custom directory in the TrinityCore source structure.  

See [doc/README.md](doc/README.md) for detailed information about each mod and customization.  

NPCBots installation guide is available in the [NPCBots Readme](https://github.com/trickerer/Trinity-Bots#npcbot-mod-installation), along with a complete guide for using the software.
