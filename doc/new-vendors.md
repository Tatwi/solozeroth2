# Solozeroth New Vendors
In a single player environment, it makes sense to increase the variety of items that the player can purchase with gold, because gold can be earned by taking part in almost all of the content in the game. Furthermore, being able to buy other currency (such as honor and raid tokens) with gold, allows the player to earn new gear and items by simply doing the content that they enjoy (rather than forcing them to solo raids, dungeons, or battlegrounds).

This is a list of all the new vendors I have added, including what they sell and where they are located in the world.
