#### Solozeroth Outland Gear Adjustments
When playing solo, all the level 70 gear is pointless, because quest greens in Northrend are easier to obtain. However, there are often times when levelling through Outland where your character could use some gear upgrades, especially right at level 60 for many classes. These changes allow the player to buy gear from various vendors at levels when the gear would still be useful.

- Badges of Justice only require level 60 (Purchased for gold in Dalaran)
- All level 61 - 70 rare gear lowered to only require level 60
- All level 70 elite gear lowered to only require level 65
- All tier 4 raid gear set pieces can each be purchased for 100 Badges of Justice
- All tier 5 raid gear set pieces can each be purchased for 150 Badges of Justice
- Death Knights can use the Warrior tier 4 and 5 raid gear
- Reduced the reputation requirement for many gear pieces sold by various Outland factions
- Made it a bit easier to get to Honored standing (with any applicable faction) by allowing reputation gain for kills up to Honored rather than just Neutral or Friendly
- Changed the Alliance dungeon quest "Weaken the Ramparts" into an open world quest to build Honor Hold / Thrallmar reputation and to collect items to turn in for Aldor or Scryer reputation. The quests "The Foot of the Citadel" (H), "Dispatching the Commander" (A), and "Drill the Drillmaster" (A) also send the player to this area.
- Lowered the first Aldor and Scryer item turn in quests to only require level 60
- Added Lower City rep turn in items (Akkora Feathers) to Akkora in Hellfire Peninsula
- Lowered the amount of Akkora Feathers required per quest and lowered the level requirement to 60
